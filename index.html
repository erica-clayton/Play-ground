    <H1>Practicing GitHub</H1>
    <p>I am so excited to be learning git and github. The commands are somewhat confusing but with practice I will learn them</p>
    <br>
    <P>The commands I know are git status to check the status of my code to github. git add. to add what I have coded so far. get commit that you always add a message with using -m to let people know what changes you have made. git push to then push the code up to github.</P>
